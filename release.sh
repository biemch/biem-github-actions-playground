#!/bin/bash

# This script automates the release process of a new project version.
# It ensures a clean working state, enforces semantic versioning,
# and creates a dedicated release branch.
#
# How to Use:
# 1. Make sure you are on the 'develop' branch and your working directory is clean.
# 2. Ensure your local branch is up-to-date with 'origin/develop'.
# 3. Run the script with the desired version number:
#    ./release.sh <version>
#    Example: ./release.sh 1.2.3
# 4. The script will:
#    - Create a new release branch (e.g., 'release/1.2.3')
#    - Update the version in package.json (without committing the tag)
#    - Generate and update the CHANGELOG.md
#    - Commit the changes to the release branch
#    - Push the release branch to the remote repository
#    - Create a pull request (PR) to merge into the main branch
#
# Requirements:
# - Git installed and properly configured
# - npm (for versioning)
# - GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
